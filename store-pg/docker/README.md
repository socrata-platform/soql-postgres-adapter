# Secondary Watcher docker support

The files in this directory allow you to build a docker image for the PG secondary watcher.  
The store-pg assembly must be copied to `store-pg-assembly.jar` in this directory before building.

## Required Runtime Variables

All variables required by [the data-coordinator secondary watcher base image](https://github.com/socrata/data-coordinator/tree/main/coordinator/docker-secondary-watcher#required-runtime-variables)
are required.  

In addition, the following are required:

* `PG_SECONDARY_INSTANCES` - A list of secondary instances to do work for.  It should be a whitespace seperated list of `name:hostname` values, eg. `pg1:10.4.23.5 pg2:pg2.example.com`.
* `PG_SECONDARY_DB_PASSWORD_LINE` - Full line of config for soql-server-pg DB password.  Designed to be either `password = "foo"` or `include /path/to/file`.  Must be the same across all instances.

## Optional Runtime Variables

All optional variables supported by [the data-coordinator secondary watcher base image](https://github.com/socrata/data-coordinator/tree/main/coordinator/docker-secondary-watcher#optional-runtime-variables)
are supported.  

In addition, the following optional variables are supported.  For defaults, see the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

* `LOG_METRICS` - Should various metrics information be logged to the log
* `PG_SECONDARY_DB_NAME` - soql-server-pg DB database name.  Must be the same across all instances.
* `PG_SECONDARY_DB_PORT` - soql-server-pg DB port number.  Must be the same across all instances.
* `PG_SECONDARY_DB_USER` - soql-server-pg DB user name.  Must be the same across all instances.
* `PG_SECONDARY_NUM_WORKERS` - Number of workers to run per secondary instance.
* `PG_SECONDARY_WORK_MEM` - The postgres `work_mem` setting to use for updating the secondary.  This is primarily useful for allowing PostgreSQL to do in memory hash aggregations when building rollup tables instead of having to spool to a temporary on disk structure.
* `PG_SECONDARY_TABLESPACE_FN` - A Clojure function used to generate the tablespace name for datasets.

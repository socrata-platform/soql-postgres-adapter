  * liquibase always commits at the end of a changeSet.

  * as one transaction.
  *
  * liquibase always rollbacks after prerequisite check.  Therefore, rollback is also ignored.

  * When this connection is used for liquibase migration, changeSet.runInTransaction must be true(which is the default).
  * Because this connection is twisted, it should not be used for anything except liquibase migration.
